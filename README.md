ropemporium but x86 now

## General
Went through this quick to gain a basic understanding of x86 binaries. No writeups attached as there are many already. All solves were done on the Ubuntu 20.04.1 box. Each solve script begins with a pause to allow the user time to attach their GDB to the process (pwntools gdb attaching was giving me issues), simply press enter to continue the script.
